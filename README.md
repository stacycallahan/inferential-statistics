# Population to Sample and Back Again: An Exploration of Inferential Statistics

Welcome! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook exploring why **inferential statistics**, using a sample to infer characteristics of a population, first requires understanding the population -> sample relationship. This project was inspired by a statistics class I took and is intended as a reflection on what I learned.

The notebook contains:
- Simulation using Python with NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- Sampling from a population
- Estimating population parameters
- Central Limit Theorem in action
- Confidence intervals and Monte Carlo simulations
